# Release CLI

The default is local publication documented in `docs/RELEASING.md`. Do not run
this Actions-dependent CLI in local mode. Use it only when the user explicitly
requests the legacy GitHub build workflow; it intentionally requires remote CI.

Run from the repository root with an explicit custom tag:

    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py inspect --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN --pr <number>
    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py promote-pr --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN --pr <number> --notes-file release-notes.md
    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py validate --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN --pr <number> --notes-file release-notes.md
    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py tag --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN --pr <number> --notes-file release-notes.md
    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py publish --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN
    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py monitor --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN
    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py verify --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN
    python3 skills/release-cli/scripts/release_cli.py finalize --tag vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN

## Release Boundary

The release candidate must first be submitted with the default `full` profile
of `push-cli submit-pr`. `promote-pr` accepts only an explicit open, non-draft,
same-repository PR to the GitHub default branch. Its typed PR marker and
profile-specific `sub2api/local-validation` status must match the current head
and current default-branch base exactly.

Before enabling auto-merge, require repository Auto-merge and merge-commit
mode, an active default-branch `pull_request` rule, strict current-branch
policy, and every repository CI, security, and local-validation status context.
Wait for GitHub required checks, recheck the unchanged proof, then run protected
native auto-merge. Never pass `--admin` or directly call a merge API that
bypasses branch policy.

After merge, resolve the actual merge commit, require it in `origin/main`, and
wait for both `CI` and `Security Scan` push workflows at that exact SHA. A tag
cannot be created before those runs succeed. The tag-triggered Release workflow
revalidates and reuses this exact provenance instead of rerunning the complete
application matrix.

## Tag and Publication

Local metadata and deterministic tree checks use `tools/release_validation.py`
and the container environment defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Apple Containers on
macOS, Docker inside WSL2 Debian/Ubuntu on Windows, and Docker on Linux. The
launcher handles Git/GitHub operations and container management. Missing runtime
or failed checks stop the operation without a host-validation fallback.

`validate` and `tag` require the merged PR number. They run only the focused
release metadata/notes/tag-absence gate; the complete application matrix was
already performed by `submit-pr` and GitHub Actions. The checked-out tree must
match the merged commit tree. `tag` creates one verified annotated local tag at
the PR's merge commit and never pushes it. External notes are staged temporarily
for container access and removed after the check. Container cleanup runs on
success and failure and preserves only current validation generations.

`publish` verifies that exact annotated tag is contained by the fetched default
branch and absent remotely. Before transfer it requires an automatic `release`
Environment limited to `v*+custom.*` tags with administrator bypass disabled,
plus an active no-bypass Tag ruleset that blocks custom-tag updates and
deletion. It then pushes only the named tag and returns. It never monitors,
verifies, uses `git push --tags`, or creates a GitHub Release manually.

`monitor` resolves the canonical remote annotated tag and observes its
tag-triggered Release workflow through automatic `Build and publish` completion.
A waiting Environment gate is policy drift and fails closed; the CLI never
approves it. `verify` is separate and requires that same remote tag, a
successfully completed workflow, non-draft Release, and both immutable pricing
assets.

## Finalization

After verification, `finalize` fetches the latest `origin/main`, creates a
deterministic `release/finalize-<version>` branch, and changes exactly one
`UPSTREAM.md` status from `planned` to `published`. It validates that historical
mapping independently from the current embedded version, synchronizes rollback
examples when a newer release has already been prepared, commits only the
mapping and those generated documentation updates, then invokes `push-cli
submit-pr --profile release-finalization --tag <tag>`. Push-cli regenerates the
complete expected tree from the recorded base and re-verifies the published
Release and immutable assets; it never runs the full application matrix for
this profile or commits/pushes main.

Promote the resulting PR through the same `promote-pr` policy after its Actions
pass, omitting `--notes-file`. That form requires the matching typed tag proof,
deterministic branch, regenerated tree, published metadata, Release workflow,
and immutable assets. Required PR and merged-main contexts classify the same
tree before selecting focused checks and fail closed on ambiguity.

## Safety

- Never promote a PR whose head/base differs from its local-validation proof.
- Never auto-merge without repository Auto-merge and required protected rules.
- Never use administrator bypass or treat the current account's admin role as
  permission to skip checks.
- Never tag an unmerged or untested commit, reuse a tag, retag, force push, or
  overwrite a published asset.
- Never publish when the release Environment or immutable custom-tag ruleset
  differs from the checked automatic policy.
- Never combine `publish`, `monitor`, and `verify`; each is independently
  resumable.
- Never switch branches with a dirty worktree or overwrite an existing
  finalization branch.

# Security Audit Content Coverage

Administrator [read-only user assistance](USER_SUPPORT_VIEW.md) exposes explicitly registered panel GET reads, including existing image history, downloads and model catalogs. Model catalogs reuse the existing discovery handlers and trusted outbound identity contract. It does not expose inference, image submission, provider probes or other gateway write paths. The real administrator remains the management-audit actor, while the separately validated target scopes reads. No inference extraction, moderation ordering or outbound identity behavior changes in this flow.

This document is the normative content-extraction matrix for Content
Moderation and Prompt Audit. The shared implementation is
`backend/internal/auditcontent`; protocol handlers and account paths must not
maintain alternate text extractors.

Usage timing observers are separate from this ingress extraction contract.
Classifying upstream `compaction`/`compaction_summary` output for timing does not
add an ingress extraction rule, policy decision, or audit bypass. Encrypted
compact output is not treated as a text-token delta; see [usage timing](USAGE_TIMING.md).

The authenticated [available-channel catalog](AVAILABLE_CHANNELS.md) is a
configuration read. Its local price calculations do not accept inference
content, select accounts, acquire inference concurrency, reserve balances or
contact providers. Catalog search and price details stay in the browser. This
view adds no inference endpoint, extraction input or alternative audit path;
actual model requests still enter both audit engines through the existing
HTTP/WS handlers before their side effects.

## Boundary And Ordering

Forwarding-account outbound identity presets are resolved after this boundary
and account selection. UA/SDK declarations are never audit inputs or an audit bypass.
Claude billing-header version rewriting uses the selected outbound identity;
the canonical inbound content shared by both audit engines stays unchanged.
OAuth, API-key, Bedrock, Vertex and compatible adapters retain the same ordering.
Token-count forwarding captures its identity only after ingress audit and
account selection, before token acquisition or request construction. Signature
retries reuse that snapshot; they do not re-extract or change the audited input.
Responses WS allocates its outbound identity scope after the first-turn audit
and before credential refresh or the upstream handshake. The scope only retains
resolver results; it does not evaluate content, select an account or perform I/O.
Reusing a scope on retry or reconnection never skips subsequent-turn audit.
Prompt Audit inference/model probes and Content Moderation calls use their own
configured supplier credentials and a separate trusted outbound identity under
[Outbound Identity](OUTBOUND_IDENTITY.md). They resolve the `openai:apikey`
type default without selecting or inheriting a forwarding account. Prompt
chunks and same-credential retries retain a supplier snapshot; failover resolves
the new owner. These headers do not change canonical extraction, scan payloads,
audit decisions or exception/pass-through semantics. Forwarding still waits for
the required ingress audit result.
Standalone search preserves `X-Codex-Turn-Metadata` for OAuth and API keys,
including opaque `mcp_request_meta` / `openai/search_context` metadata. This
protocol header is not a content-extraction input or an audit decision. The
canonical Alpha Search body (`commands`, `settings`, `input`) still enters both
engines before account selection and outbound header construction; retaining
metadata or changing the passthrough switch cannot skip that boundary.

Every accepted HTTP request, WebSocket turn, and Live Sideband client frame
must cross the same security-audit boundary after authentication and basic
request validation, but before:

1. account selection or API-key/OAuth credential normalization;
2. billing, quota reservation, or concurrency acquisition;
3. routing, retry, probe, fingerprint, or protocol transformations; and
4. any upstream request or frame write.

Responses WebSocket connection leases also follow this ordering: upgrade and
first-message syntax/model validation precede first-turn audit, and Redis ingress
capacity is acquired only after audit permits the turn. Rejected or malformed
first frames never reserve a lease. The first-message deadline bounds sockets
awaiting content. After acquisition, renewal and release cover the remaining
connection lifetime; subsequent frames still cross the canonical audit hook.

In-flight balance reservations follow the same boundary on HTTP and Responses
WebSocket paths. First-turn audit precedes session reservation; later turns
still enter both engines before billing eligibility, routing or upstream
writes. Handler and asynchronous billing-task reservation ownership changes
do not alter extraction. Standalone web/x search audits its normalized user
query before billing or reservation. Grok TTS audits its normalized spoken
text before those side effects. Claude Code fallback routing on Responses and
Chat Completions remains behind canonical audit. Unknown siblings and
unextractable content retain the existing pass-through contract.

Session affinity, account type, inbound role labels, envelope `type` values,
and protocol adapters cannot bypass the audit hook. Extraction remains
compatible with `v0.1.177+custom.003`: unsupported or unrecognized content may
produce no audit input and pass through, while every successfully extracted
sibling segment remains auditable.

Sonnet 5.5 stable computer/browser toolsets (`computer_toolset_20260801` and
`browser_toolset_20260801`) use this same Messages extraction contract. New
toolset state and unknown provider options pass through; recognized sibling
user text remains available to both engines. The stable-toolset semantic test
in `security_audit_content_contract_test.go` covers that mixed payload.

## Risk-Control User Allowlist

The admin cyber-risk center stores `cyber_policy_user_allowlist` in the settings
store, empty by default. It accepts positive platform user IDs separated by
commas or whitespace, rejects invalid IDs, and deduplicates entries. Membership
applies to all of that user's API keys. Refresh failures retain the last valid
membership snapshot and retry; a successful edit replaces it.

An allowlisted user still enters the canonical ingress audit before account
selection, billing, concurrency acquisition or upstream writes. Content
Moderation keyword, hash, pre-block and observation hits retain their evidence
with mode `risk_control_log_only`. Network-policy hits retain the existing
`cyber_policy` action with mode `cyber_log_only`. Both modes are excluded from
violation counts alongside the existing action exclusions. A log-only network
event skips both synchronous and deferred automatic bans, API-key disabling,
session-block writes and notification email, including when the Plus immediate
cyber-ban option is enabled.

This setting changes Content Moderation and cyber-risk penalties. Prompt Audit
retains its independently configured policy and shares the same extractor;
membership does not bypass its audit hook or change extraction semantics.
Unknown structures and extraction failures retain the pass-through and
structured exception-log contract below. See the allowlist service tests and
the HTTP/WS ingress side-effect ordering regressions for both engines.

## Canonical Result

The shared extractor returns a protocol-independent document containing text
segments and image inputs. Both carry `Role`, `Source`, `Current`, and
`ClientControlled`; the document also carries `ContentBearing` and `Incomplete`
classifications.

- `Current` identifies the new content in this request or turn. Consecutive
  trailing tool results are all current.
- `ClientControlled` is independent of the claimed role. A current
  `assistant` or `model` message remains client-controlled inbound content.
- Structured tool arguments and results are encoded as deterministic JSON.
- Recognized media blocks are explicit no-text content. Images remain in the
  canonical result with the same role, source, and current-turn attribution as
  their containing item. Prompt Audit does not scan URLs or encoded media as
  prompt text. Structured results are sanitized before text
  serialization so image/file URLs, data URLs, long base64 payloads, encrypted
  compaction data, screenshots, and image-generation results are not persisted;
  ordinary text beside those fields remains auditable.
- Any non-empty recognized content item that cannot be completely normalized
  may set `Incomplete` for metrics and structured logs. `Incomplete` does not
  discard successfully extracted sibling segments and does not itself block,
  return an unavailable decision, or change an empty selection into a policy
  violation.

## Protocol Matrix

| Protocol family | Canonical text sources | Current-content rule | Explicit no-text or control cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `instructions`; `tools` and `functions`; `messages[].content`; `messages[].reasoning_content`; `tool_calls[].function.arguments`; `function_call.arguments`; tool/function-role results, including structured content | Last message is current; if the tail contains tool/function results, every consecutive trailing result is current; system/developer context is current audit context. Assistant reasoning is classified as reasoning, while user-role reasoning retains direct-user attribution. | Recognized image/video content blocks |
| Anthropic Messages | `system`; `tools`; message text and thinking text; client/server tool-use input; tool-result content, including structured content | Last message is current; system and tool definitions remain current audit context | Recognized image blocks and encrypted `redacted_thinking` blocks |
| OpenAI Responses HTTP and WebSocket | Top-level, `response`-nested, or session-update `instructions`, `tools`, native `input`, legacy Chat-shaped `messages`, legacy string `prompt`, and reusable `prompt.variables`; message/reasoning/refusal text; visible `compaction`, `compaction_summary`, and `compaction_trigger` fields; function/custom/tool-search outputs; local/hosted shell, apply-patch, computer, MCP, code-interpreter, program/program-output, additional-tools, and accepted search call payloads. `POST /v1/responses/input_tokens` uses the same Responses document before any token-count account selection. Fast `service_tier` is a routing/billing field and does not bypass the audit hook. | A present non-null native `input` takes precedence over legacy `messages` and string `prompt`; otherwise `messages` precedes `prompt`. Last input item is current; every consecutive trailing recognized output is current; `tool_search_output.tools` and other dynamic definitions are current context; a claimed system/developer role remains context and all other current roles remain client-controlled. | Encrypted compaction content, IDs, status, fingerprints, recognized media/opaque items, and control envelopes produce no text; unknown frames, item types, sibling fields, and valid-JSON unrecognized structures pass through without an audit-derived block |
| OpenAI Live | Initial session instructions, tools, input, legacy `input_audio_transcription.prompt`/`keywords`, current `audio.input.transcription.prompt`/`keywords`; `session.update`; `transcription_session.update`; `conversation.item.create`; Live-shaped `response.create` | Every initial HTTP session and accepted Sideband client frame enters the audit hook before its downstream side effect or upstream write | Known control events and unknown frames, session/config fields, item types, or valid-JSON structures may produce no audit input and pass through without an audit-derived close |
| Alpha Search | Deterministically serialized, media-sanitized `commands`, `settings`, and top-level `input`, including `commands.search_query[].q` and Responses-shaped input items | Every extracted value is current; Responses-shaped input retains its item attribution. Successfully extracted siblings remain auditable when another field is incomplete. | Empty collections and media-only values; URLs, base64 payloads, and opaque media fields are omitted from structured text |
| OpenAI Embeddings | String or string-array `input` | Every string input is current | Empty input and unsupported token-ID arrays produce no audit text and pass through |
| Gemini | `systemInstruction`/`system_instruction`; tools; `contents`/`content`; batched `requests`; `instances[].prompt`; part text; `functionCall` arguments; `functionResponse.response` | Last content item is current; system and tools remain current audit context | `inlineData`/`fileData` media-only parts |
| TypeSafe System One | Question IDs; every question field name and value except the validated `type`, including `instructions` and `criteria` values; unknown question and top-level extension fields; the evaluated `state` | Every extracted leaf is current, client-controlled direct-user text; keys are visited in sorted order so the canonical document and Prompt Audit hash stay stable, and the `state` is the final canonical segment | `model`, `stream`, and validated `type` enum values produce no text; non-string scalars emit nothing and do not mark the document incomplete; a literal `<system-reminder>` or `<environment_context>` is ordinary audited evaluation text rather than CLI harness metadata |
| Images and media | Deterministic prompt-like keys such as prompt, description, query, lyrics, negative prompt, and input | Every extracted prompt is current; duplicate text is emitted once | HTTP(S) URLs, `data:image`/`data:video` values, and large base64-like media payloads |

For unknown protocol labels, the fallback recognizes Chat-shaped `messages`,
Responses-shaped `input` or `instructions`, Gemini-shaped content, Alpha
Search commands, and finally the media prompt allowlist. Unrecognized values
pass through; a newly accepted content field needs an explicit adapter before
it becomes auditable by both engines.

An envelope `type` value or empty top-level field never overrides content
present elsewhere in the payload. In particular, a non-`response.create` type
carrying `input`, `instructions`, or nested `response.input` is still
content-bearing, and top-level plus nested Responses fields are both inspected.
An unsupported envelope type is still counted and safely logged as an
extraction failure even when those sibling fields are extracted successfully.
Likewise, a media type label does not suppress recognized text in the same
content block. Unknown sibling keys are ignored, and unsupported item types,
unknown Responses/Live frames, valid-JSON unrecognized structures, and other
incomplete or unextractable content pass through. Successfully extracted
sibling content remains available to both engines. Responses passthrough and
Live Sideband still invoke the audit hook before every upstream frame write;
an extraction failure alone does not prevent that write.

A non-empty Responses or Live root, nested `response`, or session object
containing no recognized request, control, content, or metadata field is an observable
extraction failure rather than an ordinary empty request. Both engines count
and safely log that failure before allowing it. Unknown sibling keys remain
ignored when the containing object has at least one recognized field.

Call-less Codex automation and delegation bootstrap items are a documented
Responses exception to ordinary tool-output attribution. When the shared strict
wire validator confirms the supported namespace/name, envelope, missing call
anchor, unique JSON-member, and empty `previous_response_id` requirements, the
canonical extractor classifies the output as a current client-controlled user
message because the post-audit protocol adapter sends that exact text upstream
as `role=user`. Ordinary function/tool outputs, unsafe or ambiguous bootstrap
shapes, and outputs with a real call/reference anchor remain tool output and are
excluded by both engines. The handler still audits the immutable inbound bytes
before applying the actual request transform.

Anthropic and Bedrock `fallbacks` are outbound routing/control fields rather
than prompt text. Sanitizing them for upstream beta compatibility happens only
after ingress audit; recognized message, system, and tool-definition siblings
retain the canonical attribution in the protocol matrix above.

## Engine Selection

Both engines consume the same canonical document:

| Engine/mode | Segment selection |
| --- | --- |
| Content Moderation | Scans only current direct-user text and images. Chat and Anthropic require an explicit `user` role; Responses, Live, and Gemini also accept their protocol-defined roleless user forms. Direct Alpha Search queries, embedding strings, and media prompts remain eligible. Instructions, system/developer context, reusable prompt variables, assistant/model messages, reasoning, tool definitions/calls/results, approval responses, and tool-produced images are excluded so platform or external content is not attributed to the user. |
| Prompt Audit blocking and async | Scans the same current direct-user text as Content Moderation. It does not scan images. Chat and Anthropic require an explicit `user` role; Responses, Live, and Gemini also accept their protocol-defined roleless user forms. Direct Alpha Search queries, embedding strings, and media prompts remain eligible. Instructions, system/developer context, reusable prompt variables, assistant/model messages, reasoning, tool definitions/calls/results, and approval responses are excluded. A turn with no current user text is an empty selection. Client harness XML blocks inside user text (`environment_context`, `permission_profile`, `system-reminder`, `filesystem`) are stripped; surrounding user sentences remain. Native System One is the exception: its literal `<system-reminder>`/`<environment_context>` text is ordinary audited content that is never stripped, and its evaluated state is promoted to the priority segment. |

Sharing a canonical document does not mean that the engines evaluate identical
payloads. Content Moderation preserves the `v0.1.177+custom.003` attribution
rule: only a direct user submission may produce a user content-policy
violation, and it may also scan current-user images. Prompt Audit Guard scans
that same current-user text through Qwen3Guard and never treats URLs or encoded
media as prompt text. Ordinary user `hi` still blocks when that text itself is
a jailbreak. Client wrapper XML such as `<environment_context>` inside a user
message is stripped so sentences like `你能做什么？` are scanned without the
harness block. A turn containing only instructions, a tool result, or tool
schema is an empty Prompt Audit selection. Incomplete canonical extraction is
observable but does not override either engine's selection policy: extracted
content is still evaluated, while an empty selection passes through.

The optional Codex environment-timezone alignment rewrites the model-visible
`<timezone>` / `<current_date>` pair inside the stripped `<environment_context>`
wrapper block at the outbound build stage — after ingress security audit has
already consumed the original body, and never on the audit path itself. The
rewrite is cosmetic (IANA timezone name and that timezone's current date),
never injects new user text, keeps failures silent by preserving the original
self-consistent block, and therefore does not create an audit-vs-upstream
content divergence for either engine.

Content Moderation list rows keep a 240-rune redacted `input_excerpt`. The
admin detail view stores `input_content` as the same current-user scan window
sent to the external Moderation API: at most 12,000 runes after secret
redaction and NUL stripping. `input_content_truncated` is true only when the
text passed to log persistence still exceeded that window. The live Check
path normalizes to 12,000 runes before persist, so a longer original prompt
is stored as the clipped scan window with `input_content_truncated=false`.
Image URLs and raw request bodies are not persisted as detail text.

Inbound `<system-reminder>` markup is not a trust boundary. Content Moderation
treats it as ordinary direct-user text. Prompt Audit may still strip known
client-harness wrapper blocks under its documented selection policy; that
engine-specific cleanup does not suppress the same text from Content
Moderation.

## Content Moderation Text Authority

`text_api_mode` controls only the external Moderation API's authority over
text. Missing, empty, legacy, and invalid values normalize to `blocking`.
Local keyword checks, pre-hash checks, canonical extraction, and image
moderation remain independent.

| Text API mode | External text behavior | Image behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocking` | Follows the global Content Moderation mode and preserves the existing synchronous blocking behavior in `pre_block` | Follows the global mode |
| `observe` | Runs as shadow comparison only; a finding is logged as `shadow` and cannot block, seed a risk hash, notify, increment violations, or ban/disable an identity | Follows the global mode independently |
| `off` | Does not call the external API for text | Follows the global mode independently |
| `auto` | Resolves to `observe` only when active, non-degraded, synchronous Prompt Guard includes the exact request group; otherwise resolves to `blocking` | Follows the global mode independently |

The request-scoped Prompt Guard authority signal is derived inside the audit
coordinator. Async-only, disabled, degraded, untrusted, and out-of-scope Guard
configurations never grant text authority. Actions are distinct:
`hash_block`, `keyword_block`, `block`, `session_block`, `shadow`, and
`cyber_policy`.

## Content Moderation Session Block

When `session_block_enabled` is true, an API-backed Content Moderation
`pre_block` decision with `action=block` (text or image threshold hit) records
the explicit client session ID for `session_block_ttl_seconds` (default 30
days). Later HTTP and WebSocket turns that present the same tenant-isolated
session ID are rejected as `session_block` before another Moderation API call,
account selection, billing, or upstream write.

The block is independent of cyber-policy user bans and of the OpenAI cyber
session table. Keyword hits, hash blocks, shadow findings, Prompt Guard
blocks, extraction failures, and missing session IDs never seed it.
Administrators are blocked for the current request only and are not written
into the session blacklist. Raw audio frames remain unextractable and are
not a session-block trigger. Redis is a TTL cache in front of the durable
table. A cache miss or Redis error falls back to PostgreSQL and, on a live
row, rehydrates the remaining TTL with `SETNX` so later hits do not extend
expiry. A Redis hit is confirmed against PostgreSQL; an expired or deleted
row clears the cache and does not block. If Redis still has the key and
PostgreSQL is unavailable, the cached hit remains authoritative. A cache
miss plus a PostgreSQL error fails open. Administrators may list, delete a
specific tenant-isolated block key, or clear the durable session-block index
from Risk Control. Deletes and clears write PostgreSQL first, then Redis, so
a later lookup cannot resurrect a removed block. An active session block
still rejects later turns even when the current request is outside the
configured group or model filter.

## Content Moderation Endpoint Failover

External Moderation API calls use enabled endpoints in administrator-defined
priority order and rotate usable keys inside each endpoint. Retryable transport,
timeout, 5xx, invalid-response, or exhausted-key failures may place that
endpoint into cooldown and continue the same audit evaluation with the next
endpoint. Authentication and rate-limit responses first affect only the
corresponding key.

Cooldown recovery is passive: expiry never creates probe traffic. The next real
moderation request performs the single half-open attempt; concurrent requests
skip that endpoint until the attempt finishes. Manual connection tests are
administrator actions and do not run on a schedule. Context cancellation and
canonical extraction failures never penalize endpoint health. If every endpoint
is unavailable, the existing dependency-failure behavior remains authoritative;
an unavailable dependency is not converted into a policy violation.

Successful API-backed audit records snapshot the stable moderation endpoint ID
and its display name so operators can distinguish the platform that actually
produced the decision after failover. Local keyword/hash decisions, dependency
failures without a moderation decision, and historical rows keep both values
empty. Endpoint URLs, API keys, raw content, and unsanitized upstream errors are
not added to audit records.

## Prompt Audit Operations

Prompt Audit events retain at most 65,536 runes of the selected current-user
text; `full_prompt_truncated` states whether the retained value reached that
bound. The redacted preview is taken from the head of that selected text. The
scanner input limit remains at most 100,000 runes per chunk. Operational
metadata includes trusted normalized client IP, prompt length, selected
message count, execution mode, queue delay, effective input limit, matched
chunk index, and separate last-success and last-error timestamps. Client IP
filtering is exact-match. These diagnostics do not create a complete-context
download API or expand the canonical selection contract.

## Failure Semantics

All enabled engine paths expose `extraction_attempted`,
`extraction_succeeded`, `extraction_empty`, and `extraction_failed` counters.
Every extraction, evaluation, or audit-dependency exception emits a structured
log containing request ID, endpoint, protocol, stage, a stable error
code/reason, available byte counts, and bounded incomplete reasons. Logs must
not contain raw content, credentials, or unsanitized user fields. Extraction
failure is an observability outcome, never a policy violation or an unavailable
decision.

Content Moderation applies the same log contract to asynchronous persistence,
hash-cache, account-side-effect, notification, worker, cleanup, runtime, and
post-upstream cyber-policy failures. These logs use stable error categories;
they do not include raw dependency errors, panic values, or recipient email
addresses. Prompt Audit applies it to enqueue, payload-store, job-claim,
lease-refresh, completion/retry/failure persistence, worker, reclaim, startup,
shutdown, and runtime health failures.

| Engine/mode | Content-bearing extraction failure |
| --- | --- |
| Content Moderation observe | Record failure; evaluate any selected extracted content; otherwise allow |
| Content Moderation pre-block | Record failure; evaluate any selected extracted content; otherwise allow without HTTP 503 |
| Prompt Audit async | Record failure; enqueue successfully extracted content or skip an empty snapshot; never affect request forwarding |
| Prompt Audit blocking | Record failure; evaluate successfully extracted content or allow an empty snapshot without HTTP 503 |

A confirmed policy match continues to use `content_policy_violation` or the
Prompt Audit block decision. Extraction failure alone must not become a policy
block, an unavailable decision, HTTP 503, or WebSocket close. Independent audit
dependency failures retain their documented availability behavior.

Deterministic structured serialization is part of extraction. Sanitization or
JSON serialization failure may set `Incomplete` and omit that value, but does
not discard successfully extracted siblings or block the request by itself.

Live Sideband and Responses passthrough are control connections: every client
text or binary frame enters the audit hook before `upstream.WriteFrame`.
Unsupported, binary, or otherwise unextractable content passes through unless
independent transport/basic validation rejects it. WebRTC media does not
traverse the Sideband control connection and is outside this text-extraction
boundary.

## Change Evidence

Any endpoint, accepted payload field, tool form, role rule, control event, or
protocol transform that can affect inbound content must update this matrix in
the same change and provide all of the following evidence:

- production-shaped shared-extractor tests;
- the dual-engine contract in
  `backend/internal/handler/security_audit_content_contract_test.go`;
- Content Moderation and Prompt Audit payload/selection tests;
- HTTP and WebSocket ordering tests proving extraction failures pass through,
  while confirmed policy blocks still produce zero account, billing,
  concurrency, or upstream side effects; and
- Live lifecycle tests when Sideband classification or forwarding changes.

Route-call presence or static source-order assertions alone do not prove
content coverage.

## Model admission, route aliases and follow-up turns

Group `model_allowlist` admission uses the client model before account/channel
mapping and does not replace content audit. Root route aliases and Plus batch
and asynchronous image endpoints retain the same audit ordering as `/v1`.
WebSocket follow-up `response.create` calls invoke `BeforeRequest` for canonical
audit before `BeforeTurn` acquires resources; each turn invokes that acquisition
hook once. Unknown valid frames still reach the audit hook and pass extraction
without an audit-derived rejection. A real policy rejection prevents upstream
writes, including for successfully extracted content alongside unknown fields.

The [official CN provider catalog](CN_PROVIDER_MODELS.md) supplies management
allowlist candidates and the existing DeepSeek/MiniMax native Codex model
fallback lists. Updating those IDs does not add an ingress path or change the
allowlist matching rules, extraction, mapping, or side-effect boundaries above.
The DeepSeek empty-mapping admission list also accepts `deepseek-v4.1-flash`;
Flash request names are forwarded unchanged without an automatic alias mapping.
The versioned IDs `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` and `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` also use
the shared catalog for candidates and empty-mapping admission. These names use
the same extraction and audit ordering as existing names.

Named function/custom-tool inputs, allowed-tools metadata and terminal `done`
argument reconstruction do not introduce a separate extractor. If reconstructed
output returns as a later request, it follows the same shared extraction matrix
for both engines. Metadata that is not extractable content remains pass-through;
known sibling inputs remain auditable. Extraction/evaluation/dependency exceptions
retain the structured diagnostics and non-blocking behavior specified above.


DeepSeek, Kimi and MiniMax native OAuth accounts use the existing Messages,
Chat Completions and Responses ingress routes and canonical extraction. Their
new management login endpoints carry authorization data, not inference content.
Account selection, request-path credential refresh, protocol adaptation and
provider writes remain after ingress audit. Unknown valid structures retain
pass-through behavior for both API Key and native OAuth account types; known
sibling content remains auditable. Domestic OAuth credentials introduce no new
WebSocket ingress or direct WebSocket upstream capability. The account-type
pass-through regression matrix includes all three native providers, alongside
the existing HTTP/WS stage-order and canonical real-payload suites.

The domestic identity source review also permits linked GLM OAuth accounts to
use their already-derived plan API key on the OpenAI-compatible forwarding path.
This changes credential retrieval only: canonical extraction and the accepted
request's audit-before-selection boundary remain the existing CN adapter path.
No new ingress endpoint, payload shape, audit exemption, or raw-content logging
is introduced by protocol-specific outbound identity rendering.

## StepFun transport

StepFun API Key and native Step Plan OAuth use the existing audited Chat
Completions, Responses and Messages HTTP handlers. Responses/Messages convert
to Chat Completions only after canonical audit. Tool arguments/results,
reasoning content, images and unknown siblings retain the existing shared
extraction contract for both engines. Platform selection and OAuth's Bearer
credential do not introduce a pre-audit upstream operation. Native upstream
Responses WebSocket is not advertised for StepFun. The domestic account-type
pass-through matrix includes StepFun alongside the existing providers.

StepFun's administrator-only OAuth model preview (`cn/oauth/stepfun/models`)
accepts an owned ready session handle and reads a model catalog without creating
an account. It carries no inference content and preserves the existing
administrator authentication boundary. Completion stores model restrictions;
neither operation changes the gateway extraction or audit ordering contract.

StepFun response usage accepts the official flat `usage.cached_tokens` field
and retains it through both response bridges. Client model catalogs also expose
synced StepFun IDs and capabilities. These response/catalog changes introduce no
new inference input fields or audit exemptions; both account types still use the
same canonical extraction and pre-selection audit boundary above.

### Error-record attribution

Trusted local 403 denials from either engine are request refusals with the
`security_audit` usage category and no selected-account/upstream attribution.
The exact local decision, not a matching inbound/provider string, authorizes
this classification. Dependency failures keep their existing classification;
extraction failures continue to pass through under the table above. HTTP wire
bodies, WebSocket errors/closes, SLA/business-limit flags and audit ordering are
unchanged. WebSocket attribution is per turn. See
[error request diagnostics](ERROR_REQUEST_DIAGNOSTICS.md) for filtering and the
one-time historical correction.

### Grok official outbound adaptation

Grok cache keys and tenant-isolated request associations are applied only after
both audit engines consume the canonical ingress extraction. Cache routing grants
no tools: the removed Free account/client controls cannot inject hosted searches.
Explicit hosted/function name collisions follow the official Grok mapper after
audit; neither engine attributes tool definitions to the direct user. Host's
outbound project-token exception affects destination policy only and never skips
ingress audit, account ownership, billing or concurrency ordering. Existing
Responses/Chat/Messages/WS/media pass-through and side-effect-order regressions
remain mandatory; unknown and unextractable content keeps the established
pass-through contract.

# Security Audit Content Coverage

This document is the normative content-extraction matrix for Content
Moderation and Prompt Audit. The shared implementation is
`backend/internal/auditcontent`; protocol handlers and account paths must not
maintain alternate text extractors.

## Boundary And Ordering

Every accepted HTTP request, WebSocket turn, and Live Sideband client frame
must cross the same security-audit boundary after authentication and basic
request validation, but before:

1. account selection or API-key/OAuth credential normalization;
2. billing, quota reservation, or concurrency acquisition;
3. routing, retry, probe, fingerprint, or protocol transformations; and
4. any upstream request or frame write.

Session affinity, account type, inbound role labels, envelope `type` values,
and protocol adapters cannot bypass the audit hook. Extraction remains
compatible with `v0.1.177+custom.003`: unsupported or unrecognized content may
produce no audit input and pass through, while every successfully extracted
sibling segment remains auditable.

## Canonical Result

The shared extractor returns a protocol-independent document containing text
segments and image inputs. Both carry `Role`, `Source`, `Current`, and
`ClientControlled`; the document also carries `ContentBearing` and `Incomplete`
classifications.

- `Current` identifies the new content in this request or turn. Consecutive
  trailing tool results are all current.
- `ClientControlled` is independent of the claimed role. A current
  `assistant` or `model` message remains client-controlled inbound content.
- Structured tool arguments and results are encoded as deterministic JSON.
- Recognized media blocks are explicit no-text content. Images remain in the
  canonical result with the same role, source, and current-turn attribution as
  their containing item. Prompt Audit does not scan URLs or encoded media as
  prompt text. Structured results are sanitized before text
  serialization so image/file URLs, data URLs, long base64 payloads, encrypted
  compaction data, screenshots, and image-generation results are not persisted;
  ordinary text beside those fields remains auditable.
- Any non-empty recognized content item that cannot be completely normalized
  may set `Incomplete` for metrics and structured logs. `Incomplete` does not
  discard successfully extracted sibling segments and does not itself block,
  return an unavailable decision, or change an empty selection into a policy
  violation.

## Protocol Matrix

| Protocol family | Canonical text sources | Current-content rule | Explicit no-text or control cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `instructions`; `tools` and `functions`; `messages[].content`; `messages[].reasoning_content`; `tool_calls[].function.arguments`; `function_call.arguments`; tool/function-role results, including structured content | Last message is current; if the tail contains tool/function results, every consecutive trailing result is current; system/developer context is current audit context. Assistant reasoning is classified as reasoning, while user-role reasoning retains direct-user attribution. | Recognized image/video content blocks |
| Anthropic Messages | `system`; `tools`; message text and thinking text; client/server tool-use input; tool-result content, including structured content | Last message is current; system and tool definitions remain current audit context | Recognized image blocks and encrypted `redacted_thinking` blocks |
| OpenAI Responses HTTP and WebSocket | Top-level, `response`-nested, or session-update `instructions`, `tools`, native `input`, legacy Chat-shaped `messages`, legacy string `prompt`, and reusable `prompt.variables`; message/reasoning/refusal text; visible `compaction`, `compaction_summary`, and `compaction_trigger` fields; function/custom/tool-search outputs; local/hosted shell, apply-patch, computer, MCP, code-interpreter, program/program-output, additional-tools, and accepted search call payloads. `POST /v1/responses/input_tokens` uses the same Responses document before any token-count account selection. Fast `service_tier` is a routing/billing field and does not bypass the audit hook. | A present non-null native `input` takes precedence over legacy `messages` and string `prompt`; otherwise `messages` precedes `prompt`. Last input item is current; every consecutive trailing recognized output is current; `tool_search_output.tools` and other dynamic definitions are current context; a claimed system/developer role remains context and all other current roles remain client-controlled. | Encrypted compaction content, IDs, status, fingerprints, recognized media/opaque items, and control envelopes produce no text; unknown frames, item types, sibling fields, and valid-JSON unrecognized structures pass through without an audit-derived block |
| OpenAI Live | Initial session instructions, tools, input, legacy `input_audio_transcription.prompt`/`keywords`, current `audio.input.transcription.prompt`/`keywords`; `session.update`; `transcription_session.update`; `conversation.item.create`; Live-shaped `response.create` | Every initial HTTP session and accepted Sideband client frame enters the audit hook before its downstream side effect or upstream write | Known control events and unknown frames, session/config fields, item types, or valid-JSON structures may produce no audit input and pass through without an audit-derived close |
| Alpha Search | Deterministically serialized, media-sanitized `commands`, `settings`, and top-level `input`, including `commands.search_query[].q` and Responses-shaped input items | Every extracted value is current; Responses-shaped input retains its item attribution. Successfully extracted siblings remain auditable when another field is incomplete. | Empty collections and media-only values; URLs, base64 payloads, and opaque media fields are omitted from structured text |
| OpenAI Embeddings | String or string-array `input` | Every string input is current | Empty input and unsupported token-ID arrays produce no audit text and pass through |
| Gemini | `systemInstruction`/`system_instruction`; tools; `contents`/`content`; batched `requests`; `instances[].prompt`; part text; `functionCall` arguments; `functionResponse.response` | Last content item is current; system and tools remain current audit context | `inlineData`/`fileData` media-only parts |
| Images and media | Deterministic prompt-like keys such as prompt, description, query, lyrics, negative prompt, and input | Every extracted prompt is current; duplicate text is emitted once | HTTP(S) URLs, `data:image`/`data:video` values, and large base64-like media payloads |

For unknown protocol labels, the fallback recognizes Chat-shaped `messages`,
Responses-shaped `input` or `instructions`, Gemini-shaped content, Alpha
Search commands, and finally the media prompt allowlist. Unrecognized values
pass through; a newly accepted content field needs an explicit adapter before
it becomes auditable by both engines.

An envelope `type` value or empty top-level field never overrides content
present elsewhere in the payload. In particular, a non-`response.create` type
carrying `input`, `instructions`, or nested `response.input` is still
content-bearing, and top-level plus nested Responses fields are both inspected.
An unsupported envelope type is still counted and safely logged as an
extraction failure even when those sibling fields are extracted successfully.
Likewise, a media type label does not suppress recognized text in the same
content block. Unknown sibling keys are ignored, and unsupported item types,
unknown Responses/Live frames, valid-JSON unrecognized structures, and other
incomplete or unextractable content pass through. Successfully extracted
sibling content remains available to both engines. Responses passthrough and
Live Sideband still invoke the audit hook before every upstream frame write;
an extraction failure alone does not prevent that write.

A non-empty Responses or Live root, nested `response`, or session object
containing no recognized request, control, content, or metadata field is an observable
extraction failure rather than an ordinary empty request. Both engines count
and safely log that failure before allowing it. Unknown sibling keys remain
ignored when the containing object has at least one recognized field.

Call-less Codex automation and delegation bootstrap items are a documented
Responses exception to ordinary tool-output attribution. When the shared strict
wire validator confirms the supported namespace/name, envelope, missing call
anchor, unique JSON-member, and empty `previous_response_id` requirements, the
canonical extractor classifies the output as a current client-controlled user
message because the post-audit protocol adapter sends that exact text upstream
as `role=user`. Ordinary function/tool outputs, unsafe or ambiguous bootstrap
shapes, and outputs with a real call/reference anchor remain tool output and are
excluded by both engines. The handler still audits the immutable inbound bytes
before applying the actual request transform.

Anthropic and Bedrock `fallbacks` are outbound routing/control fields rather
than prompt text. Sanitizing them for upstream beta compatibility happens only
after ingress audit; recognized message, system, and tool-definition siblings
retain the canonical attribution in the protocol matrix above.

## Engine Selection

Both engines consume the same canonical document:

| Engine/mode | Segment selection |
| --- | --- |
| Content Moderation | Scans only current direct-user text and images. Chat and Anthropic require an explicit `user` role; Responses, Live, and Gemini also accept their protocol-defined roleless user forms. Direct Alpha Search queries, embedding strings, and media prompts remain eligible. Instructions, system/developer context, reusable prompt variables, assistant/model messages, reasoning, tool definitions/calls/results, approval responses, and tool-produced images are excluded so platform or external content is not attributed to the user. |
| Prompt Audit full/async | Scans the client-controlled transcript: user messages (including role-less Responses/Gemini/embeddings/media forms), plus system/developer/instructions, assistant/model text, reasoning, tool definitions/calls/results, reusable prompt variables, search queries, embedding strings, and media prompts. Stored full prompt and redacted preview remain newest-to-oldest so the preview head is the latest turn. Client harness XML blocks inside user text (`environment_context`, `permission_profile`, `system-reminder`, `filesystem`) are stripped; surrounding user sentences remain. |
| Prompt Audit blocking latest-turn-only | When enabled, scans the latest actual user text after the same client-harness XML strip, its subsequent tool results, and the nearest preceding assistant/model turn so continuation jailbreaks cannot drop the prior output. Older user turns, instructions, and tool schema stay out of this narrow window. A request with no user text cannot be narrowed safely and falls back to the full client-controlled transcript. |

Sharing a canonical document does not mean that the engines select identical
segments. Content Moderation preserves the `v0.1.177+custom.003` attribution
rule: only a direct user submission may produce a user content-policy
violation. Prompt Audit Guard scans the client-controlled transcript, so
jailbreak text in system/developer/assistant/tool fields remains visible to
blocking and async review. Ordinary user `hi` still blocks when that text
itself is a jailbreak. Client wrapper XML such as `<environment_context>`
inside a user message is stripped so sentences like `你能做什么？` are scanned
without the harness block. A turn containing only instructions, a tool
result, or tool schema is still Prompt Audit content; a request with no
recognized client-controlled text remains an empty selection. Incomplete canonical extraction is
observable but does not override either engine's selection policy: extracted
content is still evaluated, while an empty selection passes through.

Content Moderation list rows keep a 240-rune redacted `input_excerpt`. The
admin detail view stores `input_content` as the same current-user scan window
sent to the external Moderation API: at most 12,000 runes after secret
redaction and NUL stripping. `input_content_truncated` is true only when the
text passed to log persistence still exceeded that window. The live Check
path normalizes to 12,000 runes before persist, so a longer original prompt
is stored as the clipped scan window with `input_content_truncated=false`.
Image URLs and raw request bodies are not persisted as detail text.

Inbound `<system-reminder>` markup is not a trust boundary. Content Moderation
treats it as ordinary direct-user text. Prompt Audit may still strip known
client-harness wrapper blocks under its documented selection policy; that
engine-specific cleanup does not suppress the same text from Content
Moderation.

## Content Moderation Text Authority

`text_api_mode` controls only the external Moderation API's authority over
text. Missing, empty, legacy, and invalid values normalize to `blocking`.
Local keyword checks, pre-hash checks, canonical extraction, and image
moderation remain independent.

| Text API mode | External text behavior | Image behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocking` | Follows the global Content Moderation mode and preserves the existing synchronous blocking behavior in `pre_block` | Follows the global mode |
| `observe` | Runs as shadow comparison only; a finding is logged as `shadow` and cannot block, seed a risk hash, notify, increment violations, or ban/disable an identity | Follows the global mode independently |
| `off` | Does not call the external API for text | Follows the global mode independently |
| `auto` | Resolves to `observe` only when active, non-degraded, synchronous Prompt Guard includes the exact request group; otherwise resolves to `blocking` | Follows the global mode independently |

The request-scoped Prompt Guard authority signal is derived inside the audit
coordinator. Async-only, disabled, degraded, untrusted, and out-of-scope Guard
configurations never grant text authority. Actions are distinct:
`hash_block`, `keyword_block`, `block`, `session_block`, `shadow`, and
`cyber_policy`.

## Content Moderation Session Block

When `session_block_enabled` is true, an API-backed Content Moderation
`pre_block` decision with `action=block` (text or image threshold hit) records
the explicit client session ID for `session_block_ttl_seconds` (default 30
days). Later HTTP and WebSocket turns that present the same tenant-isolated
session ID are rejected as `session_block` before another Moderation API call,
account selection, billing, or upstream write.

The block is independent of cyber-policy user bans and of the OpenAI cyber
session table. Keyword hits, hash blocks, shadow findings, Prompt Guard
blocks, extraction failures, and missing session IDs never seed it.
Administrators are blocked for the current request only and are not written
into the session blacklist. Raw audio frames remain unextractable and are
not a session-block trigger. Redis is a TTL cache in front of the durable
table. A cache miss or Redis error falls back to PostgreSQL and, on a live
row, rehydrates the remaining TTL with `SETNX` so later hits do not extend
expiry. A Redis hit is confirmed against PostgreSQL; an expired or deleted
row clears the cache and does not block. If Redis still has the key and
PostgreSQL is unavailable, the cached hit remains authoritative. A cache
miss plus a PostgreSQL error fails open. Administrators may list, delete a
specific tenant-isolated block key, or clear the durable session-block index
from Risk Control. Deletes and clears write PostgreSQL first, then Redis, so
a later lookup cannot resurrect a removed block. An active session block
still rejects later turns even when the current request is outside the
configured group or model filter.

## Content Moderation Endpoint Failover

External Moderation API calls use enabled endpoints in administrator-defined
priority order and rotate usable keys inside each endpoint. Retryable transport,
timeout, 5xx, invalid-response, or exhausted-key failures may place that
endpoint into cooldown and continue the same audit evaluation with the next
endpoint. Authentication and rate-limit responses first affect only the
corresponding key.

Cooldown recovery is passive: expiry never creates probe traffic. The next real
moderation request performs the single half-open attempt; concurrent requests
skip that endpoint until the attempt finishes. Manual connection tests are
administrator actions and do not run on a schedule. Context cancellation and
canonical extraction failures never penalize endpoint health. If every endpoint
is unavailable, the existing dependency-failure behavior remains authoritative;
an unavailable dependency is not converted into a policy violation.

Successful API-backed audit records snapshot the stable moderation endpoint ID
and its display name so operators can distinguish the platform that actually
produced the decision after failover. Local keyword/hash decisions, dependency
failures without a moderation decision, and historical rows keep both values
empty. Endpoint URLs, API keys, raw content, and unsanitized upstream errors are
not added to audit records.

## Prompt Audit Operations

Prompt Audit configuration includes one global audit prompt. Missing legacy
values normalize to the built-in defensive template before an active snapshot
is installed, so an upgraded deployment does not send unframed user content
while waiting for an administrator save. Administrators may edit the template
or restore the current built-in value in the configuration page. The trimmed
value is required and limited to 20,000 Unicode code points; config audit logs
and change summaries retain only its SHA-256, never its text.

Every OpenAI-compatible Guard model call sends exactly two messages. The audit
prompt is the `system` message. The bounded audit chunk is JSON-string encoded,
wrapped in `<user_input>...</user_input>`, and sent as the separate `user`
message. JSON encoding prevents text inside the chunk from closing that tag or
claiming a new message role. Blocking evaluation, asynchronous workers, and
the model call used by endpoint probes all use the active audit
prompt. The configured `response_format` selects either the existing Qwen3Guard
`Safety` / `Categories` parser or the explicit `confidence_json` parser. JSON
requires a numeric `confidence` in [0,1] and an optional `reason`. The configured
`confidence_threshold` is inclusive: equal or higher blocks; lower passes.
The root `prompt-audit-defaults.json` owns the default threshold (0.8) and JSON
template. Missing fields on legacy stored configurations retain Qwen3Guard;
there is no response-format detection or fallback between parsers.

The model probe always calls Chat Completions and parses its response using
the current editor draft (or the saved configuration for legacy clients). A
successful models listing alone cannot report a healthy audit node.
Latest-turn selection also includes tool outputs following the latest actual
user turn. Anthropic tool_result blocks remain tool outputs even though their
envelope role is user. Full-transcript selection preserves upstream behavior.

Prompt Audit events retain at most 65,536 runes of canonical selected content
in newest-to-oldest order; `full_prompt_truncated` states whether the retained
value reached that bound. The redacted preview is taken from the head of that
newest-first text. The scanner input limit remains at most 100,000 runes per
chunk. Operational
metadata includes trusted normalized client IP, prompt length, selected
message count, execution mode, queue delay, effective input limit, matched
chunk index, and separate last-success and last-error timestamps. Client IP
filtering is exact-match. These diagnostics do not create a complete-context
download API or expand the canonical selection contract.

## Failure Semantics

All enabled engine paths expose `extraction_attempted`,
`extraction_succeeded`, `extraction_empty`, and `extraction_failed` counters.
Every extraction, evaluation, or audit-dependency exception emits a structured
log containing request ID, endpoint, protocol, stage, a stable error
code/reason, available byte counts, and bounded incomplete reasons. Logs must
not contain raw content, credentials, or unsanitized user fields. Extraction
failure is an observability outcome, never a policy violation or an unavailable
decision.

Content Moderation applies the same log contract to asynchronous persistence,
hash-cache, account-side-effect, notification, worker, cleanup, runtime, and
post-upstream cyber-policy failures. These logs use stable error categories;
they do not include raw dependency errors, panic values, or recipient email
addresses. Prompt Audit applies it to enqueue, payload-store, job-claim,
lease-refresh, completion/retry/failure persistence, worker, reclaim, startup,
shutdown, and runtime health failures.

| Engine/mode | Content-bearing extraction failure |
| --- | --- |
| Content Moderation observe | Record failure; evaluate any selected extracted content; otherwise allow |
| Content Moderation pre-block | Record failure; evaluate any selected extracted content; otherwise allow without HTTP 503 |
| Prompt Audit async | Record failure; enqueue successfully extracted content or skip an empty snapshot; never affect request forwarding |
| Prompt Audit blocking | Record failure; evaluate successfully extracted content or allow an empty snapshot without HTTP 503 |

A confirmed policy match continues to use `content_policy_violation` or the
Prompt Audit block decision. Extraction failure alone must not become a policy
block, an unavailable decision, HTTP 503, or WebSocket close. Independent audit
dependency failures retain their documented availability behavior.

Deterministic structured serialization is part of extraction. Sanitization or
JSON serialization failure may set `Incomplete` and omit that value, but does
not discard successfully extracted siblings or block the request by itself.

Live Sideband and Responses passthrough are control connections: every client
text or binary frame enters the audit hook before `upstream.WriteFrame`.
Unsupported, binary, or otherwise unextractable content passes through unless
independent transport/basic validation rejects it. WebRTC media does not
traverse the Sideband control connection and is outside this text-extraction
boundary.

## Change Evidence

Any endpoint, accepted payload field, tool form, role rule, control event, or
protocol transform that can affect inbound content must update this matrix in
the same change and provide all of the following evidence:

- production-shaped shared-extractor tests;
- the dual-engine contract in
  `backend/internal/handler/security_audit_content_contract_test.go`;
- Content Moderation and Prompt Audit payload/selection tests;
- HTTP and WebSocket ordering tests proving extraction failures pass through,
  while confirmed policy blocks still produce zero account, billing,
  concurrency, or upstream side effects; and
- Live lifecycle tests when Sideband classification or forwarding changes.

Route-call presence or static source-order assertions alone do not prove
content coverage.

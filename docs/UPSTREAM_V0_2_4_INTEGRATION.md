# Upstream v0.2.4 integration

This source integration uses the commit and publication status recorded in
[UPSTREAM.md](../UPSTREAM.md).

The migration numbers below are upstream identifiers. In the owned GoToCC
lineage, upstream 259–263 are imported unchanged as 263–267; all earlier
owned SQL remains immutable. See [owned migration history](GOTOCC_PLUS_MIGRATION.md).

## Upgrade and public API

The group field `models_list_config` becomes `model_allowlist` in storage and
management JSON. Enabled policies govern both model listing and inference
admission, using the client's model before account/channel/composite mapping.
Management clients must use the new field. An enabled empty list is rejected
on new writes. Trailing wildcards and existing model alias equivalence remain
supported; a literal `*` is an explicit administrator policy, never an automatic
upgrade replacement.

Migrations 259 and 260 rename/repair the field; 261 adds MiniMax platform
constraints. Their committed contents remain immutable. Migration 262 trims
entries, removes case-insensitive duplicates in order, and disables legacy
enabled empty/blank lists, preserving the old display-only empty-list behavior.
It emits a PostgreSQL notice containing the affected group ID. Malformed JSON
shapes, non-string entries and non-trailing wildcards stop the migration with
the group ID; repair these configurations before retrying the upgrade. No model
names, prompts or credentials are included in those diagnostics.

Migration 263 recognizes an existing bootstrapped installation by the presence
of user rows before migrations run. It preserves explicit `persist_access_logs`
values and fills a missing field with true for those installations. Fresh
databases have no users at this stage and keep the application default false.
Existing unrelated runtime-log fields are preserved. Malformed runtime-log
configuration must be repaired before upgrading. Ordinary access-log persistence
does not control required security-audit exception logging.

When using an explicit upstream URL allowlist, add `api.minimax.io` for the
MiniMax international site; `api.minimaxi.com` covers the China site. Existing
explicit lists are not merged with new defaults. The system-log cleanup fallback
is `ops.cleanup.system_log_retention_days: 30`; it must be positive when cleanup
is enabled. Runtime ops settings may override the fallback. Both defaults are
shown in [the deployment example](../deploy/config.example.yaml).

Back up the database before deploying this schema change. Replacing the binary
with an older version alone cannot reverse renamed columns. After migration or new writes, preserve the current data and apply a reviewed
forward compensation. Do not overwrite current data with an older dump or edit
applied migration checksums.

## Plus integration decisions

| Area | Integrated behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Astra defaults | Retain Plus strict `gpt-6-astra` recognition, low default reasoning and existing context-window policy while incorporating mode/Ultra metadata. Bare or invented aliases do not become supported inference models merely because a prompt selector recognizes their family. |
| Model discovery | Public/API-key and Codex/OAuth catalogs share raw source caching; group filtering occurs afterwards. Credential-owner identity resolves before building cache keys and outbound headers. |
| WebSocket lifecycle | Each accepted turn is audited before side effects. `BeforeTurn` executes once per turn, with terminal/error cleanup and Plus timing retained. Unknown valid frames follow the canonical pass-through audit contract. |
| Tool events | Partial deltas and terminal `done` events are combined without duplication. Missing terminal tool inputs can be recovered from the matching observed call; explicit populated terminal inputs are preserved. |
| MiniMax | Platform, group, quota, monitor and composite-route support is included. Coding-plan credential origin must be an exact approved HTTPS hostname; third-party host/path/query/userinfo lookalikes do not initiate an official quota query. |
| Grok | Missing or inconclusive OAuth entitlement does not authorize media forwarding. Explicit administrator enable/disable wins; clearing it restores automatic evaluation. Native billing observation remains separate from retired generic upstream probes. |
| Defaults | Grok cross-client model rewriting stays disabled; GoToCC user rankings remain administrator-only; redeem failures use a new atomic fixed ten-minute window with a limit of 30. |
| Images | Image 2.5 and Plus synchronous, batch and asynchronous paths coexist. `SUB2API_IMAGES_MAIN_MODEL` defaults to `gpt-5.6-luna` in deployment examples. |
| Administration | Preserve usage alerts, export controls, inactive-group selection, quota reset windows, payment checkout tabs and simple-mode server restrictions. |

## Local acceptance boundary

The owned workflow builds the final package in Docker using the pinned source
toolchain and runs that package against the preserved local preview database.
Only focused diagnosis is used to resolve observed integration problems. User
manual acceptance precedes publication of the same package. No full test matrix,
GitHub rebuild, or production update is implied by local startup.

## GoToCC compatibility

Smart keys evaluate the selected group's model allowlist against the public
model before composite/channel mapping, and recheck the current policy on
admission. Discovery uses the same alias semantics. Responses WebSocket turns
retain smart routing, per-turn audit, account binding and allowlist evaluation.
Root image/video aliases retain the upstream middleware ordering and the owned
persistent object/task handlers. Ordinary users cannot enter the users-ranking
tab, including through historical deep links; administrator access is retained.

## Post-publication audit corrections

The published `v0.2.4+custom.001` tag does not include the subsequent correction
that moves WebSocket ingress lease acquisition after first-frame security audit.
The correction is included in `v0.2.4+custom.002`. See
[WebSocket ingress limits](protocols/OPENAI_RESPONSES.md#websocket-ingress-limits)
for the corrected `1013` capacity-close behavior. It also covers a pre-existing
ordering violation in `v0.2.1+custom.003`; published tags and artifacts remain
immutable.

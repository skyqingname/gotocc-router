# OpenAI Responses and WebSocket Ingress

Sub2API Plus accepts OpenAI-compatible Responses requests over HTTP and
client-facing WebSocket ingress. Account routing can use an upstream WebSocket
or bridge the client WebSocket to an HTTP/SSE upstream.

Usage timing follows the shared [first-token/total-duration/TPS contract](../USAGE_TIMING.md),
including HTTP passthrough, individual WS turns, and remote compaction. Aggregate
compact output does not create a token clock. The obsolete `openai_ttft_mode`
admin setting has been removed; `timing_version` identifies verified usage data.

## GPT-6 Astra

The gateway uses OpenAI's canonical `gpt-6-astra` model ID. For Plus client
compatibility, the legacy `gpt-6` spelling is accepted only as an alias and is
canonicalized to `gpt-6-astra`; it is not a separate model or billing identity.
Reasoning-level suffixes are never treated as model IDs.
Astra accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` reasoning effort;
it does not accept `none` or `minimal`. Configured Codex catalogs default it
to `low` and preserve `max` as distinct from `xhigh` in request and usage
metadata. The additional Codex catalog level `ultra` is a client-side
multi-agent preset that delegates with `xhigh`; it is never sent upstream as
an API reasoning effort.

Generated API client configuration advertises the 1,050,000-token API context
window and 128,000-token maximum output. Configured Codex catalogs follow the
Codex client contract separately: the active context window is 272,000 and the
maximum configuration override is 872,000.

Default OpenAI model catalogs and model-mapping presets list Astra first. The
admin account test UI still prefers `gpt-5.6-sol` when it is available, so
catalog presentation order does not silently change the connectivity probe.

Default API cost accounting uses $10 input, $1 cached input, $12.50 cache
write, and $50 output per million tokens. Flex is half of Standard and Fast is
twice Standard. OpenAI publishes Batch at half of Standard through its separate
Batch API; this Responses gateway does not infer Batch from `service_tier`.
When total input is 272,001 tokens or more, the whole-request long-context
policy multiplies all ordinary input, cache-read input, and cache-write input
by 2 and all output by 1.5. The 272,000-token boundary retains Standard rates.
Platform API-key Astra requests always apply this official cost policy;
ChatGPT OAuth account policy remains independently configurable. Group and
channel custom selling-price overrides retain their existing precedence.

Astra tool calling requires the Responses API. Callers must omit
`temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_logprobs`; Chat Completions callers must also
omit `logprobs`, and Responses callers must not request
`message.output_text.logprobs` through `include`. Fast/priority processing is
not available with EU data residency and does not carry a latency SLA.
Responses features such as async tool calls, `configuration_update`, and
mid-turn WebSocket steering pass through the gateway without Astra-specific
rewriting.

## Prompt Cache Identity and Usage

Current Codex clients can supply the canonical `session-id`, `thread-id`, and
`x-client-request-id` headers. The gateway also accepts the supported legacy
session aliases, including `session_id`, for sticky routing compatibility.
When direct session headers are absent, the stable string `session_id` inside
`X-Codex-Turn-Metadata` is also accepted; request-scoped `turn_id` is never a
routing key. This lets `/v1/responses` WebSocket ingress and
`/v1/alpha/search` share one account route even when Alpha Search would
otherwise fall back to its search ID.
The same sanitized value is recorded as `usage_logs.session_id` and participates
in cyber-session blocking. Endpoint fallbacks and `turn_id` remain routing
details and are not persisted as client session IDs.
Thread and client-request identifiers remain paired request context and never
replace the session-scoped cache identity.

For OpenAI Responses and Compact requests, the gateway resolves one opaque,
tenant-isolated cache identity from an explicit `prompt_cache_key`, a supported
session header, or a stable content prefix with a meaningful user/input anchor.
It writes the finalized UUID to both the upstream `prompt_cache_key` and the
canonical `session-id` header; the legacy `session_id` alias carries the same
value. A model-only request does not receive a content-derived key. API-key
Chat Completions requests converted to Responses use the same behavior, while
raw Chat Completions forwarding does not receive Responses-only cache fields.

Under the default hard-affinity mode, account priority changes do not replace a
valid active session route. The optional sticky-weighted scheduler mode remains
score-based by design. If the configured health/concurrency sticky escape
temporarily bypasses a degraded account, a movable Responses continuation does
not fall back to that account through its older response ID; the temporary
candidate order is derived from the shared session identity, while the
canonical sticky binding remains unchanged. Removing an account from the
requesting group, disabling it, or making it incompatible is always a hard
invalidation: both ordinary sticky routing and `previous_response_id` routing
recheck the current account before reuse. Long-lived Responses WebSocket
connections also run current billing and reload the selected account before
every turn in `ctx_pool`, `http_bridge`, and `passthrough` modes. The refreshed
account must still satisfy group, status, schedulability, quota, client-model,
endpoint-capability, transport, parent-health, runtime-block, scheduling
threshold, and proxy-quarantine gates. Follow-up image intent also repeats the
group permission and Responses-capability checks. If any gate fails, the
gateway closes before sending that turn upstream; a reconnect then performs
normal account selection. The first turn is billed-eligible once before
selection, while every later turn is checked once at its pre-turn boundary. A
movable WebSocket continuation follows a session route that has already failed
over to another account and removes the old account's response ID before
forwarding. Tool-output continuations without complete call context remain on
the response owner and keep the existing fail-closed OAuth ownership checks.

`prompt_cache_options` is forwarded only for GPT-6 Astra and GPT-5.6-family
OpenAI Platform API-key Responses/Compact traffic. ChatGPT OAuth and older or
unknown model families have that field removed. Deprecated
`prompt_cache_retention` is removed on every path. Current callers should use
`prompt_cache_options.ttl` with the only supported value, `30m`; setting
`mode` to `explicit` disables the implicit cache breakpoint.

Usage ingestion treats ordinary input, cache-read input, and cache-write input
as mutually exclusive stored buckets. Usage pages may report each bucket's
share of total tokens, but do not derive a prompt-cache hit rate from these
counters.
Canonical nested usage details take priority by field presence, including an
explicit zero, before known top-level compatibility aliases are considered.

## Codex Rate-Limit Response Headers

For Codex Responses requests, successful HTTP and SSE responses can include
the following rate-limit fields for both `Primary` and `Secondary` windows.
WebSocket upgrade responses include the same fields when the local Codex
subscription quota view is enabled:

- `X-Codex-*-Used-Percent` is the consumed percentage.
- `X-Codex-*-Window-Minutes` is the window length in minutes.
- `X-Codex-*-Reset-At` is the next reset time as Unix seconds.
- `X-Codex-*-Reset-After-Seconds` remains alongside `Reset-At` for older
  clients that only understand a relative countdown.

When local Codex subscription quota is enabled, `Primary` represents the local
7-day window and `Secondary` represents the local rolling 5-hour window. This
local view is authoritative even when the selected OpenAI account enables
automatic passthrough. The gateway clears all upstream default rate-limit
fields before writing the local values, so one response never mixes upstream
reset times with local percentages or window sizes.

When the local view is disabled, the selected account's real default quota is
visible only when that account enables OpenAI automatic passthrough. Otherwise
the gateway removes the default `Primary` and `Secondary` quota fields after
generic response-header filtering, so an additional response-header allowance
cannot bypass this policy.

A client WebSocket `101` response is committed before the gateway connects to
the selected upstream. The gateway therefore writes only the local quota view
known before the upgrade. The official WebSocket client updates quota from
in-band `codex.rate_limits` events, so the gateway applies the same policy to
the default `codex` event family: replace it with local subscription windows,
pass it through for an automatic-passthrough account, or suppress it. Named
model-specific limit families remain independent. HTTP and SSE headers are
finalized before their response bodies are written.

The dedicated `/backend-api/wham/usage` route remains a local-only view. It
returns the API key subscription quota when the local setting is enabled and
returns 404 otherwise; it does not select an account or proxy upstream quota.

Administrators may optionally bind an OpenAI subscription group to one
credential-owning OpenAI OAuth account that is already bound to that group.
This does not change the group's routing pool. The gateway never polls an
upstream quota endpoint for this feature. It passively observes the source
account's raw default weekly-window `Reset-At` value on successful Responses
traffic and the equivalent default `codex.rate_limits` WebSocket event before
applying any client-facing local quota rewrite. Only an explicit 10,080-minute
window is eligible; daily, 5-hour, monthly, and unknown windows never drive this
feature.

Saving a new or changed binding locks its source and establishes a baseline
from the latest locally observed value in the same transaction. If no value
exists yet, the first observation establishes the baseline without resetting
subscriptions. Ordinary group edits, including copying members while retaining
the same reset source, preserve the current baseline and configuration generation; stale
source-configuration saves are rejected for reload. A later next-reset time
creates a durable, idempotent reset event only after the previously announced
window has expired, and only when the new timestamp is at least half a week
later. Clock skew of a still-open or just-expired window does not reset groups.
Each event resets the active subscriptions' 5-hour, daily, and weekly usage;
monthly usage is reset only when the group explicitly enables it and has a
monthly limit. Event application and usage billing lock the group and
subscription records in the same order, so a concurrent charge is
deterministically ordered before or after the reset. Deleting the source
account, or removing it from the group, leaves its recorded name and ID on the
group for diagnosis, but disables further automatic resets until another
eligible bound source is selected.

Source membership is checked when creating reset events and again when either
billing or the background worker applies them. An unbound source neither advances
the group's baseline nor clears usage through a previously pending event.
Observation and worker paths acquire the group lock before rechecking membership
in a fresh statement, so a lock wait cannot retain pre-edit membership. The worker
also refreshes source eligibility before applying any reset.

An accepted timestamp repeated by the source still reconciles groups whose
baseline is missing or behind, subject to the same expiry and weekly-advance
checks. An existing account observation must not cause a newly bound group's
first baseline to be skipped. Synchronized groups do not create duplicate events.

Creating or editing a group with copied accounts commits its configuration,
membership and scheduler outbox entries together. A failed copy rolls back the
entire write. Copying an unchanged source cannot temporarily expose an unbound
source to reset workers. Copied accounts are locked before the group, in ID
order, matching observation lock ordering and avoiding membership-FK deadlocks.

Multiple workers process each group's pending events in order, preserving
earlier monthly-reset decisions. Billing consumes eligible pending events
before adding the request's cost, including inside a caller-owned transaction;
subsequent worker passes cannot erase that cost. Pending events with deleted,
ineligible, disabled, or replaced sources are ignored by both paths. Persistence
of an already received upstream observation uses a bounded five-second context
independent of downstream cancellation and makes no additional upstream call.

This response-header compatibility does not make Codex App API-key calls to
`account/rateLimits/read` available; that App Server authentication behavior is
outside this gateway's request path.

## Codex Fingerprint Convergence

OpenAI OAuth accounts may rewrite outbound Codex installation, session, and
thread carriers. Unset accounts use `device` mode. Ordinary Responses,
Chat-Completions-to-Responses, Messages-to-Responses, HTTP-to-WebSocket, and
direct Responses WebSocket turns use the configured account mode. Native
remote Compact v2 is an ordinary Responses session for fingerprint purposes
and therefore also uses the full configured mode. The ChatGPT Codex OAuth
legacy compact compatibility path uses installation-only convergence for every
non-`off` mode and preserves its own compact session, cache, and thread
namespace.

Here `legacy` refers only to the ChatGPT Codex OAuth compatibility branch used
by this gateway. The public API-key
[`/v1/responses/compact`](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/java/resources/responses/methods/compact)
endpoint remains a distinct supported OpenAI API surface. Response retrieve,
cancel, and other non-create subpaths are not session turns and receive no
fingerprint mutation.

Fingerprint preparation runs before final request construction. Plus
prompt-cache/session isolation is authoritative for the final `session-id` and
`session_id` headers, while fingerprint convergence remains authoritative for
installation and thread/turn metadata. `off` disables only fingerprint-owned
header and body mutation; it does not disable Plus cache isolation, security,
session sharing, or compact policy. WebSocket connection reuse compares final
stable handshake carriers even when `off` or `device` leaves those values
client-owned. Usage-log `session_id` stays the sanitized client-original value.

Only credential-owning OpenAI OAuth accounts participate. Personal access
token and Agent Identity accounts follow the same endpoint semantics because
they are OpenAI OAuth credential owners. API-key, setup-token, and non-session
endpoints such as count-tokens and alpha-search are excluded. User-Agent,
Originator, and Version use one source chain: valid credential-owner
`credentials.user_agent`, then valid global `openai_codex_user_agent`, then the
compiled default. Version synchronization changes only the version declaration
of the selected identity.

## Security Audit Content Boundary

Inbound Responses content is normalized for Content Moderation and Prompt
Audit before account selection, billing, concurrency acquisition, fingerprint
convergence, request adaptation, or upstream writes. API-key and OAuth account
paths therefore use the same audit content.

The canonical boundary covers top-level and `response`-nested `instructions`,
`tools`, `input`, reusable `prompt.variables`, message text, tool definitions,
and the arguments, input, output, result, or dynamic tools carried by function,
custom, tool-search, local/hosted shell, apply-patch, computer, MCP,
code-interpreter, and programmatic-tool-calling items. Media fields and
encoded screenshots are removed before text serialization and persistence;
ordinary text in the same structured result is retained.

Content Moderation consumes the same canonical result but selects only the
current direct-user message text and images. It excludes `instructions`, tool
definitions, reusable prompt variables, assistant/model messages, reasoning,
tool calls/results, approval responses, and tool-produced screenshots. This
prevents platform context or external tool content from being reported as a
user policy violation. Prompt Audit also consumes that canonical result, but
its selection follows `v0.1.177+custom.003`: conversation text such as
`instructions`, message text, and reusable prompt variables is scanned, while
static `tools` schemas and structured tool-call arguments/results are not
treated as prompt text. Latest-turn blocking scans the latest user text plus
the nearest preceding assistant/model output.
A supported WebSocket control frame may produce no audit input. Unknown sibling
keys, unsupported event/item types, and valid-JSON unrecognized structures pass
through without an audit-derived block. When the canonical extractor recognizes
`input`, `instructions`, or nested `response.input`, an envelope `type` value
does not suppress those extracted segments. An unsupported envelope type is
still counted and safely logged as an extraction failure while those extracted
segments remain auditable.
Non-empty root, nested `response`, and session objects with no recognized field
are counted and safely logged as extraction failures before they pass through;
unknown sibling keys on an otherwise recognized object remain ordinary success.
Direct passthrough runs the audit hook for every client text or binary frame,
including `conversation.item.create` and `session.update`, before any
non-`response.create` frame is forwarded. Unsupported binary/JSON content and
recognized items that cannot be normalized are logged and pass through unless
independent transport/basic validation rejects them. Successfully extracted
sibling content remains auditable. Extraction failure alone never becomes a
policy block, unavailable decision, HTTP 503, or WebSocket close. Compact
keepalive output and channel mapping start only after this gate. The audit uses
an immutable copy of the inbound body so compact normalization and reasoning
policy rewrites cannot remove content from the audited view.

The complete protocol/source matrix is maintained in
[`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_CONTENT_COVERAGE.md`](../SECURITY_AUDIT_CONTENT_COVERAGE.md).

## Request Replay and Upstream Failures

When a Responses request replays a previous tool call, the gateway preserves an
item `id` only when its prefix matches the item type. In particular,
`custom_tool_call` uses `ctc...`; a mismatched item ID is removed rather than
rewritten. Its `call_id` remains unchanged so the paired
`custom_tool_call_output` continues to reference the original call.

The exact local proxy response `507` with
`exceeded request buffer limit while retrying upstream` is not an account or
model failure. The gateway stops replaying the request, keeps the selected
account eligible, and returns an OpenAI-compatible `413` with:

```text
Request payload is too large to retry safely
```

Reduce the request size or adjust the reverse-proxy retry-buffer policy before
retrying. The gateway does not retry that request through another account,
because doing so can duplicate work and billing while encountering the same
buffer limit.

Connection refusal/reset and HTTP `504` gateway failures are recorded as
provider or proxy transport failures rather than model-capacity failures. A
proxy-backed OpenAI account is isolated by the bounded proxy circuit, keyed by
the configured proxy ID; a shared proxy incident therefore does not directly
put every associated account into an account-level cooldown. Management error
records retain only structured, bounded diagnostic categories and never store
raw proxy URLs, credentials, or outbound User-Agent values.

For the native HTTP/SSE and WebSocket paths, diagnostics distinguish an edge
gateway timeout from the gateway's own response-header, first-semantic-output,
and WebSocket first-semantic-output deadlines. A first-output timeout may use
the existing single, pre-output controlled failover path; it is never enabled
after semantic output has reached the client.

## WebSocket Ingress Limits

`gateway.openai_ws` bounds the lifetime and aggregate count of client-facing
sessions independently from per-turn user and account concurrency:

```yaml
gateway:
  openai_ws:
    client_first_message_timeout_seconds: 30
    ingress_inter_turn_idle_timeout_seconds: 300
    max_ingress_connections_per_api_key: 64
```

- The first-message timeout covers receiving and decompressing the complete
  first client message.
- The inter-turn timeout closes idle sockets after a completed turn; `0`
  disables it.
- The API-key connection cap is distributed through Redis; `0` disables it.

The connection lease is acquired after the first frame passes basic validation
and security audit, before user/account concurrency, billing and upstream work.
An upgraded socket waiting for its first frame is bounded by the first-message
timeout and does not yet consume a Redis lease. Capacity exhaustion or an
unavailable lease backend closes the upgraded socket with code `1013` (try again
later); clients should reconnect with backoff. Audit rejection retains its own
error frame and close status and never consumes a connection lease.

Large contexts or slow image-heavy requests may require a higher first-message
timeout. The timeout expires before HTTP bridge routing and is not overridden
by bridge mode.

Distributed connection leases last 60 seconds and refresh every 20 seconds. If
a process cannot confirm a lease for a full lease lifetime, it closes the local
socket instead of continuing outside the global cap.

## Mode Router

Enable the v2 mode router before selecting an account WebSocket mode such as
`http_bridge`:

```yaml
gateway:
  openai_ws:
    mode_router_v2_enabled: true
```

The environment equivalent is
`GATEWAY_OPENAI_WS_MODE_ROUTER_V2_ENABLED=true`. Use `http_bridge` when the
client keeps a WebSocket while the selected upstream uses HTTP/SSE.


### Downstream disconnect attribution (GoToCC)

A failed write to the caller is distinct from an upstream HTTP or terminal
response failure. Positively identified client disconnects return the typed
`ErrOpenAIClientDisconnected` result, retain collected usage for settlement,
and mark a `client_disconnect` network event. No generic 502 SSE frame is
appended to the closed connection. Ops retains the actual wire HTTP status
(often 200), assigns the event to the downstream/client side and excludes it
from provider-error counters and account health failure observations.

This classification identifies the direction of the failed connection, not
whether the user, a proxy, an SSH tunnel or the network initiated closure.
Existing upstream terminal failures keep their original classification.


### Client access defaults

The one-click Codex configuration and CCS import defaults share
`client-access-defaults.json` (`openai_model: gpt-6-astra`). HTTP and WS configs
use this preference for both `model` and `review_model`. When an administrator
explicitly fetches a restricted account model catalog, the existing catalog
selection rules still apply. Personal/team Key scope and authentication remain
unchanged; this setting does not rewrite users' existing local client files.

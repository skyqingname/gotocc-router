# DeepSeek

Native OAuth login is available in account creation and editing. See
[login, refresh, endpoints and operational details](DOMESTIC_OAUTH.md).

Sub2API Plus accepts DeepSeek accounts through the OpenAI-compatible gateway
and Claude Code-style Anthropic entry points.

## Empty model mapping

When a DeepSeek account has no `model_mapping`, the scheduler admits only the
supported request names (case-insensitive):

- `deepseek-flash`
- `deepseek-v4.1-flash` (versioned request name; upstream determines support)
- `deepseek-v4-pro`
- `deepseek-v4-flash` (compatibility alias; upstream still accepts it)
- `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` (versioned flash name)
- `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` (compatibility alias)
- `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` (versioned pro name)

The scheduler and model selectors share the [model catalog](../CN_PROVIDER_MODELS.md),
which displays Flash aliases and versioned Flash/Pro names separately.
With no explicit administrator mapping, their spelling is sent upstream unchanged;
the project does not rewrite aliases to `deepseek-flash` or pin that name to V4.1.
The current pricing page recommends `deepseek-flash` and confirms the two V4 Flash
compatibility names; it does not separately document `deepseek-v4.1-flash` as an API ID.

Unknown names fail at scheduling with `404 model_not_found`. They are not
forwarded upstream, so they cannot trigger per-(account, model) cooldown or be
silently rewritten to `deepseek-flash` by DeepSeek.

Claude Code's `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=deepseek-flash[1m]` form is normalized before
the whitelist check, and the `[1m]` suffix is stripped on the DeepSeek outbound
path only. Configured `model_mapping` keeps mapping-first semantics. OpenAI
passthrough accounts still skip mapping admission and send the client model
unchanged.

## Outbound identity

DeepSeek API-key accounts use the pinned **DeepSeek** preset by default
(`nativeOutboundPreset`), so DeepSeek receives exactly one declaration:

```
User-Agent: deepseek-harness/0.2.0-rc.2 (+https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)
```

The parenthesized product comment belongs to that same User-Agent value
(published-harness attribution), so no `Originator` or `Version` header is sent.
The preset replaced the earlier Codex default, which had sent
`Originator: codex_cli_rs` and `Version: 0.158.0` alongside the Codex
User-Agent; those two declarations are now absent on this platform. The harness
`x-deepseek-harness-user-id`, `-session-id` and `-compact` request headers keep
their protocol-layer ownership and are never rewritten by the identity layer.

OAuth and API-key accounts retain the DSH family. System Settings configures
the global DeepSeek profile; valid account parameters can override that profile.
There is no configurable `deepseek:apikey` mapping or cross-family account override.
Protocol selection
(`api_protocol` / adaptive routing), API-protocol conversion, model admission,
billing and the ingress audit order are unaffected: identity chooses outbound
declarations only. Ingress audit order and Plus session/quota accounting are
unchanged.

The **DeepSeek · DSH Desktop** card in System Settings shows this exact UA.
The desktop delegates both its account-token and API-key model requests to the
same vendored Harness adapter; its shell package version does not select the
identity version. The resolver applies the same native family to OAuth owners,
with atomic account/global/default fallback and a stable per-operation snapshot.
Source evidence and the shared matrix are in [Outbound identity](../OUTBOUND_IDENTITY.md).

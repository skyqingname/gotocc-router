Sub2API Plus v0.1.178+custom.006

## Highlights

- Keep Content Moderation on current direct-user text and images.
- Restore Prompt Audit conversation-text selection to `v0.1.177+custom.003`, so ordinary Codex `hi` requests are not blocked by client tool schemas.
- Continue sharing one canonical extractor, without converting extraction failures into policy blocks.
- Preserve every active GotoCC production contract (LC-001 through LC-004 and LC-006 through LC-012) while keeping retired LC-005 absent.
- Keep all NewAPI-backed video models in one OpenAI-compatible group and accept Infinite Canvas generation aliases without Composite or model-prefix routing.

## Changed

- Prompt Audit full/async scans messages, instructions/system context, reusable prompt variables, reasoning, and search/embedding/media prompts.
- Prompt Audit no longer sends static `tools`/`functions` schemas, structured tool-call arguments, or tool/function outputs to Qwen3Guard.
- Blocking latest-turn-only again scans only the latest user text plus the nearest preceding assistant/model output.
- Compose asynchronous-image failed-task deletion and private exact ZIP keys with durable PostgreSQL ownership, same-user URL renewal, and streaming uploads; storage keys are not exposed in public JSON.
- Preserve atomic registration-time consumption for both one-time and reusable invitation codes.
- Keep all NewAPI-backed video models in one OpenAI-compatible group. Accept the
  legacy `/videos/generations` create, status, and content aliases used by
  Infinite Canvas and normalize them to NewAPI's canonical `/v1/videos` task
  surface without introducing Composite or model-prefix routing. Channel
  create/update validation now also accepts the existing `video` billing mode,
  allowing per-second rules to be maintained through the normal admin API.

## Fixed

- Stop treating Codex and other client tool definitions as jailbreak prompt text.
- Keep `hi` plus a large tool schema from producing a Prompt Audit block while still scanning jailbreak text in user/system/assistant conversation content.

## Compatibility and migration

- No new database migrations relative to the deployed GotoCC baseline. Existing Prompt Audit endpoints, scanners, and jailbreak policy remain compatible; only the scanned conversation-text selection is restored.
- Content Moderation preserves compatibility with current direct-user text and images.
- Existing GotoCC migrations remain immutable and keep their full filenames; no manual migration command is required.

## Known issues

- None known.

# Contributing to Sub2API Plus

Thank you for contributing. Repository-wide mandatory rules are in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); this guide provides the working commands and review
flow.

## Toolchain

Use the versions declared by the repository:

- Go: `backend/go.mod`
- Node.js and pnpm: `frontend/package.json`
- Application release: `backend/cmd/server/VERSION`
- Release and lint tools: `.tool-versions`

Install frontend dependencies with pnpm only:

```bash
pnpm --dir frontend install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Development Checks

All validation, including focused checks while iterating, must run in the
platform validation container: Docker on macOS and Linux, and Docker inside
WSL2 Debian or Ubuntu on Windows. Do not run tests, lint,
typechecking, builds, policy checks, or other validation on the host.
After every validation attempt, successful or failed, remove the one-shot
project validation container, temporary resources, and historical writable
snapshots. Retain the Sub2API validation image whose deterministic identity
matches the current resolved Go, Node, pnpm, golangci-lint, and GoReleaser pins.
Retain dependency caches only for the generation matching that image and the
current Go and pnpm lock inputs. Remove stale Sub2API validation generations;
never prune unrelated projects or global runtime, builder, image, volume, or
system resources.

Inside that container, with GNU Make available, run the repository checks from
the root:

```bash
make test
```

The equivalent focused commands are:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
go mod tidy -diff
go test -tags=unit ./...
go test -tags=integration ./...
golangci-lint run ./...

# Frontend, from the repository root
pnpm --dir frontend run lint:check
pnpm --dir frontend run typecheck
pnpm --dir frontend run test:run

# Repository AGENTS.md contract
python3 skills/compress-cli/scripts/compress_cli.py check AGENTS.md
python3 skills/compress-cli/tests/test_compress_cli.py
```

Run the focused tests for the changed package or component inside the same
platform validation container while iterating.
Intermediate branch pushes use the fast path and do not run local tests:

```bash
python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py push
```

Before creating or updating the final pull request, run the promotion gate:

```bash
python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py submit-pr
```

`submit-pr` defaults to the `full` profile. It requires the latest
default-branch base and runs the complete matrix inside Docker on macOS and
Linux or Docker inside WSL2 Debian or Ubuntu on Windows.
Independent backend-test, backend-lint/policy, and frontend lanes run with
bounded concurrency and report step/lane wall-clock durations; no check is
removed. Host-side execution of any validation is forbidden. For diagnosis or a
same-commit timing baseline, pass `--serial` to `check`.

The `release-finalization` profile is not a general fast option. Only
`release-cli finalize` may request it for a verified published tag and a tree
that can be regenerated exactly from its recorded base. Both profiles bind the
exact base/head SHAs, and finalization also binds the tag. Release PR merging
and publication use `skills/release-cli` after GitHub required checks pass.

## Generated Code

After changing `backend/ent/schema`, regenerate Ent and Wire:

```bash
cd backend
go generate ./ent
go generate ./cmd/server
```

Commit the generated output. Do not edit generated Ent or Wire files directly.

## Database Changes

Read [`backend/migrations/README.md`](backend/migrations/README.md) before
adding a migration. Existing migrations are immutable. Use the next unique
numeric prefix and create a forward-only migration.

## Documentation and Localization

- Update English and Chinese frontend locales together.
- Keep the three README core section IDs aligned.
- Put detailed operational content in `docs/` or `deploy/`.
- Add user-visible changes to the release notes.

## Specifications

Use a local OpenSpec change to plan cross-cutting features or changes to public
APIs, persistent data, security boundaries, or multi-module behavior. The
`openspec/changes/` directory is intentionally untracked and must not be
included in pull requests. Start from the tracked example under
`openspec/examples/` when useful.

Record durable behavior in the owning documentation and automated tests. Use
pull request descriptions and commit history for change rationale. Small fixes
and documentation-only changes do not require an OpenSpec plan.

## Pull Requests

Keep changes focused and use the existing commit style, such as `feat:`,
`fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, and `chore:`. Complete the pull request checklist
and include:

- The problem and intended behavior
- Important implementation or compatibility decisions
- Tests performed
- Migration, configuration, documentation, and release-note impact

Release publication is a separate maintainer action. A pull request must not
create or move release tags.

Never push `main` directly. The repository ruleset and local CLI must both
require pull requests. A PR head or default-branch base change after
`submit-pr` invalidates its local-validation proof and requires resubmission.
